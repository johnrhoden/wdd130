            <p class="armyp"> When I was 18, I joined the Army National Guard as a Combat Engineer and later as a Vertical Engineer. I served in both Utah and Virginia. While in the Utah Army National Guard, I completed humanitarian missions in Cambodia and the Dominican Replubic. During college, I interned at the National Defense University in Washington, DC.While in the Virginia Guard, I served in a historic unit, Alpha Company 116th.There is a New York Times best-seller written about this company called the Bedford Boys. On the cover it states "the true story that inspired Saving Private Ryan." In 2015, I finished my military service. </p>

            <p class="politicsp">In my early twenties, I dropped out of college to work in politics. I started working on the Romney campaign in 2012 as an  unpaid intern and finished the campaign as an aide to the candidate and candidate's spouse. After the campaign, I worked at the National Republican Senatorial Committee as an aide to Senator Rob Portman. In the 2016 presidential cycle, I organized political events for Scott Walker and Marco Rubio.</p>

            <p class="telecomp">In 2016, I chose the perfect time to exit politics and pursue an MBA. Following my MBA, I got an offer to work in a leadership development program for T-Mobile called Leaders 2 Executive. This program gave me the opportunity to lead large teams and work across the busienss in Care, Retail, and now Digital. For the last 3 years, I've worked in digital product management on T-Mobile's app and web. </p>
