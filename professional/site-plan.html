        My career has spanned politics, military service, and telecom. I've been blessed to live and work in several large cities, including Washington, DC, Boston, MA, Chicago, IL, Springfield, MO, and Bellevue, WA. For the last 5 years I've worked at T-Mobile USA. Prior to that I earned my MBA from BYU and worked in politics and served in the Army National Guard.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I enrolled at Brigham Young University - Provo as a freshman. While an undergrad, I participated in ROTC and Washington Seminar. Before my junior year, I was offered a full-time job and postponed school for several years to work in politics. Eventually, I finished my degree by taking courses from a local community college in Virginia and through BYU online. In August 2014, I graduated from BYU with a bachelors in general studies, with an emphasis in American studies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In Augut 2015, I returned to Provo to earn my Masters in Business Administration from Brigham Young University. While there, I interned at Blue Raven Solar and served as the president of the BYU Veterans club. While I struggled my first year to secure an internship, I was blessed in my second year to receive 6 full-time job offers to Amazon, Johnson and Johnson, Delta Airlines, Union Pacific, Blue Raven Solar, and T-Mobile. In April 2017, I graduated with my MBA with minors in analytics and information systems. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In September 2022, I enrolled in BYU Pathways to pursue a certificate in Web and Computer Programing.I work in digital product management and am pursuing this certificate to increase my technical acumen. So far, I've been very pleased with the instruction, instructor, tools, TAs, and resources.

      <p>

        My career has spanned military service, politics, and telecom. When I was 18, I joined the Army National Guard as a Combat Engineer and later as a Vertical Engineer. I served in both Utah and Virginia. While in the Utah Army National Guard, I completed humanitarian missions in Cambodia and the Dominican Replubic. During college, I interned at the National Defense University in Washington, DC.While in the Virginia Guard, I served in a historic unit, Alpha Company 116th.There is a New York Times best-seller written about this company called the Bedford Boys. On the cover it states "the true story that inspired Saving Private Ryan." In 2015, I finished my military service. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In my early twenties, I dropped out of college to work in politics. I started working on the Romney campaign in 2012 as an 
        unpaid intern and finished the campaign as an aide to the candidate and candidate's spouse. After the campaign, I worked at
        the National Republican Senatorial Committee as an aide to Senator Rob Portman. In the 2016 presidential cycle, I organized political 
        events for Scott Walker and Marco Rubio.
      </p>

      <p>
      In 2016, I chose the perfect time to exit politics and pursue an MBA. Following my MBA, I got an offer to work in a leadership development program for T-Mobile called Leaders 2 Executive. This program gave me the opportunity to lead large teams and work across the busienss in Care, Retail, and now Digital. For the last 3 years, I've worked in digital product management on T-Mobile's app and web.
