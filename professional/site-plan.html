        My career has spanned politics, military service, and telecom. I've been blessed to live and work in several large cities, including Washington, DC, Boston, MA, Chicago, IL, Springfield, MO, and Bellevue, WA. For the last 5 years I've worked at T-Mobile USA. Prior to that I earned my MBA from BYU and worked in politics and served in the Army National Guard.

      </ul>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I have earned an undergraduate degree and graduate degree from BYU-Provo. Now, I am continuing my educational journey by 
        pursuing an associate degree in Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho. I am passionate about learning and strive to be a life-long learner. 
        I beleive this latest degree in technology will increase my technical acuman.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began studying at BYU-Provo in 2005. I lived in Helaman Halls, joined ROTC, and loved playing intramural sports. I had several jobs as a student, including cleaning the MTC, teaching Norwegian at the MTC, and working as a teaching assistant for American Heritage.  During my sophomore year, I participated in Washington Seminar. That experience led to several full-time jobs in politics in the east coast. I eventually finished my undergraduate degree through BYU Online. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017, I retunred to BYU to earn my MBA. While there, I interned at Blue Raven Solar and served as the president of the BYU Veterans club.

      <h3>Employers</h3>
      <p>
        My career has spanned military service, politics, and telecom. 
      </p>
      <p>

        When I was 18, I joined the Army National Guard as a Combat Engineer and later as a Vertical Engineer. 
        I served in both Utah and Virginia. While in the Utah Army National Guard, I completed humanitarian missions in Cambodia and the Dominican Replubic. During college, I interned at the National Defense University in Washington, DC.
        While in the Virginia Guard, I served in a historic unit, Alpha Company 116th.There is a New York Times best-seller written about this company called the Bedford Boys. On the cover it states "the true story that inspired Saving Private Ryan." In 2015, I finished my military service. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In my early twenties, I dropped out of college to work in politics. I started working on the Romney campaign in 2012 as an 
        unpaid intern and finished the campaign as an aide to the candidate and candidate's spouse. After the campaign, I worked at
        the National Republican Senatorial Committee as an aide to Senator Rob Portman. In the 2016 presidential cycle, I organized political 
        events for Scott Walker and Marco Rubio.
      </p>

      <p>
      In 2016, I chose the perfect time to exit politics and pursue an MBA. Following my MBA, I got an offer to work in a leadership development program for T-Mobile called Leaders 2 Executive. This program gave me the opportunity to lead large teams and work across the busienss in Care, Retail, and now Digital
