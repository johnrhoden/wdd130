            <p>I enrolled at Brigham Young University - Provo as a freshman. While an undergrad, I participated in ROTC and Washington Seminar. Before my junior year, I was offered a full-time job and postponed school for several years to work in politics. Eventually, I finished my degree by taking courses from a local community college in Virginia and through BYU online. In August 2014, I graduated from BYU with a bachelors in general studies, with an emphasis in American studies. </p>

            <p>In Augut 2015, I returned to Provo to earn my Masters in Business Administration from Brigham Young University. While there, I interned at Blue Raven Solar and served as the president of the BYU Veterans club. While I struggled my first year to secure an internship, I was blessed in my second year to receive 6 full-time job offers to Amazon, Johnson and Johnson, Delta Airlines, Union Pacific, Blue Raven Solar, and T-Mobile. In April 2017, I graduated with my MBA with minors in analytics and information systems. </p>
